# Markdown Themes
This is where I work on creating web styles for HTML generated from Markdown.

**NOTE:** At the moment this is more of a sandbox than anything else.

My primary incentive is to expand my collection of available themes and styles for [Mou](http://25.io/mou/), the Markdown editor I like best. The first thing I'm tackling is a stylesheet designed to mimic the official GitHub README appearance. While the underlying CSS/SASS is still quite hacky, [my current rendition](mou/CSS/github-sb.css) serves as a near-perfect replica, which suits me for the time being.
